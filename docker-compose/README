This subdirectory and structure is built to be the backbone of all the development for the Acronym DB project.

It is comprised of many different pieces that are brought together in the docker-compose.yml file.

It includes subdirectories with information about the various sub systems that are individually dockerized.

The docker containers include:
   php - a container containing the CGI for apache
   apache - a container containing the apache web server (external port 8080)
   db - a container containing the mysql instance (external port 3306)
   adminer - a container containing the admin script to manage MySQL (external port 8081)
   flask - a container containing the webservice flask (external port 5000)

The system also uses named networks to segment traffic between the pieces

networks:
   - backend - used by php, apache, db, adminer, flask
   - frontend - used by apache, flask

The database has a persisted volume called mysql-data that holds the persisted database files

To start everything you can issue the following docker compose command:
           docker-compose up --build
           setup the database

FOR THE FUTURE
   should have: 
       - a persisted volume for the public_html for the web server 
       - a persisted volume for the flask web services (everything under /code directory in the /flask sub directory)
       - perhaps move all of this code under /docker-compose up to the main level
